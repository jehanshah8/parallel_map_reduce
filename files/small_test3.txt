<head>Chapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov</head>

<p>
Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son
of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known
in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing
to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago,
and which I shall describe in its proper place. For the present I
will only say that this <q>landowner</q>&mdash;for so we used to call him,
although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate&mdash;was a
strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject
and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those
senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their
worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch,
for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of
the smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on
them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred
thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life
one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district.
I repeat, it was not stupidity&mdash;the majority of these fantastical fellows
are shrewd and intelligent enough&mdash;but just senselessness, and
a peculiar national form of it.
</p>

<p>
He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by
his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor
Pavlovitch's first wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly
rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district,
the Miüsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also
a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so
<pb n='002'/><anchor id='Pg002'/>
common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the
last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all
called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the
last <q>romantic</q> generation who after some years of an enigmatic
passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have married
at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and
ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and
rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished,
entirely to satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's
Ophelia. Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers,
had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in
its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place.
This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar
instances in the last two or three generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna
Miüsov's action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's
ideas, and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom.
She wanted, perhaps, to show her feminine independence, to
override class distinctions and the despotism of her family. And a
pliable imagination persuaded her, we must suppose, for a brief
moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his parasitic position,
was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch,
though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.
What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an
elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna's fancy.
Fyodor Pavlovitch's position at the time made him specially eager
for any such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a
career in one way or another. To attach himself to a good family
and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love
it did not exist apparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite
of Adelaïda Ivanovna's beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of
the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a
voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on the
slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman
who made no particular appeal to his senses.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned
in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt.
The marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with
extraordinary rapidity. Although the family accepted the event
<pb n='003'/><anchor id='Pg003'/>
pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the
husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there
were everlasting scenes between them. It was said that the young
wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fyodor
Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up
to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she received it, so that
those thousands were lost to her for ever. The little village and the
rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his
utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by means of some
deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded, merely
from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from the
contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless
importunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda Ivanovna's family intervened
and circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact
that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but
rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but
was beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed,
impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally,
she left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a
destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old,
in her husband's hands. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced
a regular harem into the house, and abandoned himself to orgies of
drunkenness. In the intervals he used to drive all over the province,
complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaïda Ivanovna's having
left him, going into details too disgraceful for a husband to
mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to gratify
him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part
of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with embellishments.
</p>

<p>
<q>One would think that you'd got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,</q> scoffers said
to him. Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part
in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it
funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position.
But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last he succeeded
in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor woman
turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity
student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete
emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about,
<pb n='004'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>
making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could
not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but
having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself
for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just
at that time his wife's family received the news of her death in
Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to
one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation.
Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife's death, and
the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with
joy, raising his hands to Heaven: <q>Lord, now lettest Thou Thy
servant depart in peace,</q> but others say he wept without restraint
like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in
spite of the repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions
were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time
wept for her who released him. As a general rule, people, even the
wicked, are much more naïve and simple-hearted than we suppose.
And we ourselves are, too.

<head>Chapter II. He Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son</head>

<p>
You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and
how he would bring up his children. His behavior as a father
was exactly what might be expected. He completely abandoned the
child of his marriage with Adelaïda Ivanovna, not from malice,
nor because of his matrimonial grievances, but simply because he
forgot him. While he was wearying every one with his tears and
complaints, and turning his house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful
servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya
into his care. If he hadn't looked after him there would have been
no one even to change the baby's little shirt.
</p>

<p>
It happened moreover that the child's relations on his mother's
side forgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living,
his widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was
seriously ill, while his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained
for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived
<pb n='005'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>
with him in the servant's cottage. But if his father had remembered
him (he could not, indeed, have been altogether unaware of his
existence) he would have sent him back to the cottage, as the child
would only have been in the way of his debaucheries. But a cousin
of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, happened to return
from Paris. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but
was at that time quite a young man, and distinguished among the
Miüsovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture,
who had been in the capitals and abroad. Towards the end of his
life he became a Liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties.
In the course of his career he had come into contact with
many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and
abroad. He had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in
his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the
Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had
almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades. This was one
of the most grateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent
property of about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old
style. His splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and
bordered on the lands of our famous monastery, with which Pyotr
Alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit, almost as soon as he
came into the estate, concerning the rights of fishing in the river or
wood-cutting in the forest, I don't know exactly which. He regarded
it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an
attack upon the <q>clericals.</q> Hearing all about Adelaïda Ivanovna,
whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had at one time
been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he intervened,
in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He made the latter's acquaintance for the first
time, and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child's
education. He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch,
that when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked
for some time as though he did not understand what child he was
talking about, and even as though he was surprised to hear that he
had a little son in the house. The story may have been exaggerated,
yet it must have been something like the truth.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly
playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing
<pb n='006'/><anchor id='Pg006'/>
so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance,
in the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very
great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like
Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business
through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch,
joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and
land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this
cousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and
after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at
once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady
living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in
Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of
February broke out, making an impression on his mind that he remembered
all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya
passed into the care of one of her married daughters. I believe
he changed his home a fourth time later on. I won't enlarge upon
that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch's
firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts
about him, without which I could not begin my story.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was
the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in the
belief that he had property, and that he would be independent on
coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did
not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school,
then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was
degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and
spent a good deal of money. He did not begin to receive any income
from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then
got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for
the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood
on purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to
have liked his father. He did not stay long with him, and made
haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of
money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from
the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact
worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his
father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this,
too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea
<pb n='007'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>
of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with
this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the
young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient,
and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he
would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So
Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending
him from time to time small doles, installments. In the end, when
four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our
little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out
to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get
an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property
in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even
in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of
his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right
to expect anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man
was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost
beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe,
the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory
story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass
to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's other two
sons, and of their origin.

<head>Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family</head>

<p>
Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands
Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage
lasted eight years. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also
a very young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon
some small piece of business in company with a Jew. Though
Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he
never neglected investing his capital, and managed his business
affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over-scrupulously.
Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was
left from childhood an orphan without relations. She grew up
in the house of a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position,
<pb n='008'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>
who was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not
know the details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a
meek and gentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in
which she was hanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her
sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old
woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an
insufferable tyrant through idleness.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about
him and he was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed
an elopement to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt
that she would not on any account have married him if she had
known a little more about him in time. But she lived in another
province; besides, what could a little girl of sixteen know about it,
except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than
remaining with her benefactress. So the poor child exchanged a
benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a
penny this time, for the general's widow was furious. She gave
them nothing and cursed them both. But he had not reckoned on
a dowry; what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent
girl, above all her innocent appearance, which had a peculiar
attraction for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only
the coarser types of feminine beauty.
</p>

<p>
<q>Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,</q> he used to say
afterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this
might, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had
received no dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her
<q>from the halter,</q> he did not stand on ceremony with her. Making
her feel that she had <q>wronged</q> him, he took advantage of her
phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary
decencies of marriage. He gathered loose women into his
house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife's presence.
To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that
Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who
had always hated his first mistress, Adelaïda Ivanovna, took the
side of his new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor
Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion
broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of
the house. In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror
<pb n='009'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>
from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is
most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be <q>possessed
by devils.</q> At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even
lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan
and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second
three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth
year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother
all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the
same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother,
Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their
father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in
his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who
had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all
those eight years, forgotten the insult done her. All that time she
was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya's manner of life,
and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared
aloud two or three times to her retainers:
</p>

<p>
<q>It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.</q>
</p>

<p>
Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna's death the general's
widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor
Pavlovitch's house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she
did a great deal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had
not seen for those eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is
that instantly upon seeing him, without any sort of explanation, she
gave him two good, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by a
tuft of hair, and shook him three times up and down. Then, without
a word, she went straight to the cottage to the two boys.
Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in dirty
linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and announcing
that she would carry off both the children she wrapped
them just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove
off to her own town. Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted
slave, without a word, and when he escorted the old lady to her
carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that,
<q>God would repay her for the orphans.</q> <q>You are a blockhead all
the same,</q> the old lady shouted to him as she drove away.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good
thing, and did not refuse the general's widow his formal consent to
<pb n='010'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>
any proposition in regard to his children's education. As for the
slaps she had given him, he drove all over the town telling the story.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left
the boys in her will a thousand roubles each <q>for their instruction,
and so that all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition
that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it
is more than adequate provision for such children. If other people
think fit to throw away their money, let them.</q> I have not read
the will myself, but I heard there was something queer of the sort,
very whimsically expressed. The principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch
Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the province, turned out, however,
to be an honest man. Writing to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and
discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him for
his children's education (though the latter never directly refused
but only procrastinated as he always did in such cases, and was,
indeed, at times effusively sentimental), Yefim Petrovitch took a
personal interest in the orphans. He became especially fond of the
younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as one of his family.
I beg the reader to note this from the beginning. And to Yefim
Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met
with, the young people were more indebted for their education and
bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand roubles
left to them by the general's widow intact, so that by the time they
came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation
of interest. He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly
spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them.
I won't enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth,
but will only mention a few of the most important events. Of the
elder, Ivan, I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose
and reserved, though far from timid boy. At ten years old he
had realized that they were living not in their own home but on
other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it
was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his
infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude
for learning. I don't know precisely why, but he left the
family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering
a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated
teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to
<pb n='011'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>
declare afterwards that this was all due to the <q>ardor for good
works</q> of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that
the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But
neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young
man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As
Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the
tyrannical old lady's legacy, which had grown from one thousand to
two, it was delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and
the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the
university, as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was
studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate
with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for
him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that
from such a father he would get no real assistance. However that
may have been, the young man was by no means despondent and
succeeded in getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and
afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers
under the signature of <q>Eye-Witness.</q> These paragraphs,
it was said, were so interesting and piquant that they were soon
taken. This alone showed the young man's practical and intellectual
superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of
both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals,
unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for
copying and translations from the French. Having once got into
touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept up his connection
with them, and in his latter years at the university he published
brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so
that he became well known in literary circles. But only in his
last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a
far wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and
remembered him. It was rather a curious incident. When he had
just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two
thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more
important journals a strange article, which attracted general notice,
on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing,
as he was a student of natural science. The article dealt with
a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time&mdash;the
position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions
<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>
on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was
most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected
conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly
as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even
atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons
opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical
burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article
penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where
the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the
ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning
the author's name, they were interested in his being a native of
the town and the son of <q>that Fyodor Pavlovitch.</q> And just then
it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.
</p>

<p>
Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking
myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit,
which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never
fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that
a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious,
should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had
ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him,
and would not under any circumstances have given him money,
though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would
also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying
in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two
months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact
was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me.
Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, of whom we have spoken already,
the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, happened to be in the
neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had come from
Paris, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was
more surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the
young man, who interested him extremely, and with whom he
sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself
in acquirements.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is proud,</q> he used to say, <q>he will never be in want of pence;
he has got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want
here? Every one can see that he hasn't come for money, for his
father would never give him any. He has no taste for drink and
<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>
dissipation, and yet his father can't do without him. They get on
so well together!</q>
</p>

<p>
That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence
over his father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently
and even seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often
extremely and even spitefully perverse.
</p>

<p>
It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at
the request of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri,
whom he saw for the first time on this very visit, though he had
before leaving Moscow been in correspondence with him about an
important matter of more concern to Dmitri than himself. What
that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even
when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan
Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather
mysterious.
</p>

<p>
I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a
mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was
in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action
against him.
</p>

<p>
The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some
of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger
brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been
the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find
it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give
some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact,
which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing
the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been for the last year in our
monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest
of his life.

<head>Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha</head>

<p>
He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth
year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven.
First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha,
was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning.
He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the
monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to
say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of
worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason this life
struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as he
thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to
whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent
heart. But I do not dispute that he was very strange even at that
time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I have mentioned
already, by the way, that though he lost his mother in his fourth
year he remembered her all his life&mdash;her face, her caresses, <q>as though
she stood living before me.</q> Such memories may persist, as every
one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but
scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out
of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all
faded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was
with him. He remembered one still summer evening, an open
window, the slanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most
vividly of all); in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a
lighted lamp, and on her knees before the image his mother, sobbing
hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him up in both arms,
squeezing him close till it hurt, and praying for him to the Mother
of God, holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put
him under the Mother's protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs
in and snatches him from her in terror. That was the picture!
And Alyosha remembered his mother's face at that minute. He used
to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he
rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood
and youth he was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed,
but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary,
from something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely
personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important to
him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it.
But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life to put
implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton
or naïve person. There was something about him which made
one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
not care to be a judge of others&mdash;that he would never take it upon
himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything.
He seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation
though often grieving bitterly: and this was so much
so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest
youth. Coming at twenty to his father's house, which was a very
sink of filthy debauchery, he, chaste and pure as he was, simply
withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable, but without
the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation. His father, who
had once been in a dependent position, and so was sensitive and
ready to take offense, met him at first with distrust and sullenness.
<q>He does not say much,</q> he used to say, <q>and thinks the more.</q>
But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to embracing him and
kissing him terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality,
yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him,
such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one before.
</p>

<p>
Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and
it was so from his earliest childhood. When he entered the household
of his patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he
gained the hearts of all the family, so that they looked on him quite
as their own child. Yet he entered the house at such a tender age
that he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning
affection. So that the gift of making himself loved directly and
unconsciously was inherent in him, in his very nature, so to speak.
It was the same at school, though he seemed to be just one of those
children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and even disliked
by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for instance, and rather
solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a
corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was
at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see
at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness. On the
contrary he was bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show
off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never
afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that he was
not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was
bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would happen
that an hour after the offense he would address the offender or
answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
though nothing had happened between them. And it was not that
he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront,
but simply that he did not regard it as an affront, and this completely
conquered and captivated the boys. He had one characteristic
which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the
top want to mock at him, not from malice but because it amused
them. This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity.
He could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations
about women. There are <q>certain</q> words and conversations unhappily
impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure in mind and
heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among themselves,
and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which even
soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much
that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite
young children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no
moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is
the appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as
something refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing
that Alyosha Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked
of <q>that,</q> they used sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands
away, and shout nastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped
to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of
abuse, enduring their insults in silence. But at last they left him
alone and gave up taunting him with being a <q>regular girl,</q> and
what's more they looked upon it with compassion as a weakness.
He was always one of the best in the class but was never first.
</p>

<p>
At the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more
years to complete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable
widow went almost immediately after his death for a long visit to
Italy with her whole family, which consisted only of women and
girls. Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of
Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he had never seen before. On what
terms he lived with them he did not know himself. It was very
characteristic of him, indeed, that he never cared at whose expense
he was living. In that respect he was a striking contrast to his
elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two
years in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and
had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense
<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>
of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha's character
must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance
with him any one would have perceived that Alyosha
was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious enthusiast,
who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune,
would not hesitate to give it away for the asking, either for
good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he seemed
scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a literal
sense. When he was given pocket-money, which he never asked for,
he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment,
or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
</p>

<p>
In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive
on the score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following
judgment, after getting to know Alyosha:
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might
leave alone without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of
a million inhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not
die of cold and hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once;
and if he were not, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would
cost him no effort or humiliation. And to shelter him would be no
burden, but, on the contrary, would probably be looked on as a
pleasure.</q>
</p>

<p>
He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before
the end of the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he
was going to see his father about a plan which had occurred to him.
They were sorry and unwilling to let him go. The journey was
not an expensive one, and the ladies would not let him pawn his
watch, a parting present from his benefactor's family. They provided
him liberally with money and even fitted him out with new
clothes and linen. But he returned half the money they gave him,
saying that he intended to go third class. On his arrival in the town
he made no answer to his father's first inquiry why he had come
before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually
thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for his
mother's tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that
was the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the
whole reason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not
understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
soul, and drawn him irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable
path. Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him where his second
wife was buried, for he had never visited her grave since he had
thrown earth upon her coffin, and in the course of years had entirely
forgotten where she was buried.
</p>

<p>
Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not
been living in our town. Three or four years after his wife's death
he had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa,
where he spent several years. He made the acquaintance at first,
in his own words, <q>of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,</q>
and ended by being received by <q>Jews high and low alike.</q> It may
be presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for
making and hoarding money. He finally returned to our town only
three years before Alyosha's arrival. His former acquaintances
found him looking terribly aged, although he was by no means an
old man. He behaved not exactly with more dignity but with
more effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity
for making buffoons of others. His depravity with women was
not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting. In a short
time he opened a great number of new taverns in the district. It
was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not
much less. Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were
soon in his debt, and, of course, had given good security. Of late,
too, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more
uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing
and go on with another, as though he were letting himself go altogether.
He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had
not been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged
considerably too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like
a tutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.
Alyosha's arrival seemed to affect even his moral side, as though
something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had
long been dead in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you know,</q> he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, <q>that
you are like her, <q>the crazy woman</q></q>&mdash;that was what he used to call
his dead wife, Alyosha's mother. Grigory it was who pointed out
the <q>crazy woman's</q> grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town
cemetery and showed him in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone,
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
cheap but decently kept, on which were inscribed the name and
age of the deceased and the date of her death, and below a four-lined
verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class
tombs. To Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be
Grigory's doing. He had put it up on the poor <q>crazy woman's</q>
grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had
often pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the
grave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion
at the sight of his mother's grave. He only listened to Grigory's
minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood
with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word. It was
perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this little
episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch&mdash;and
a very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our
monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for
the second, Alyosha's mother, the <q>crazy woman,</q> but for the
first, Adelaïda Ivanovna, who used to thrash him. In the evening
of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha.
He himself was far from being religious; he had probably never
put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses
of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance
at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably
to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his
little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude
of deep wrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam's apple hung
below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a
peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious
mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little stumps of
black decayed teeth. He slobbered every time he began to speak.
He was fond indeed of making fun of his own face, though, I believe,
he was well satisfied with it. He used particularly to point to
his nose, which was not very large, but very delicate and conspicuously
aquiline. <q>A regular Roman nose,</q> he used to say, <q>with my
goiter I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman patrician of
the decadent period.</q> He seemed proud of it.
</p>

<p>
Not long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly announced
that he wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
were willing to receive him as a novice. He explained that this was
his strong desire, and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his
father. The old man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living
in the monastery hermitage, had made a special impression upon
his <q>gentle boy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is the most honest monk among them, of course,</q> he observed,
after listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming
scarcely surprised at his request. <q>H'm!... So that's where you
want to be, my gentle boy?</q>
</p>

<p>
He was half drunk, and suddenly he grinned his slow half-drunken
grin, which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy
slyness. <q>H'm!... I had a presentiment that you would end in
something like this. Would you believe it? You were making
straight for it. Well, to be sure you have your own two thousand.
That's a dowry for you. And I'll never desert you, my angel. And
I'll pay what's wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of
course, if they don't ask, why should we worry them? What do you
say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week.
H'm!... Do you know that near one monastery there's a place
outside the town where every baby knows there are none but <q>the
monks' wives</q> living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe.
I have been there myself. You know, it's interesting in its own
way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it's awfully Russian.
There are no French women there. Of course they could get them
fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it
they'll come along. Well, there's nothing of that sort here, no
<q>monks' wives,</q> and two hundred monks. They're honest. They
keep the fasts. I admit it.... H'm.... So you want to be a
monk? And do you know I'm sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would
you believe it, I've really grown fond of you? Well, it's a good
opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much
here. I've always been thinking who would pray for me, and
whether there's any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I'm
awfully stupid about that. You wouldn't believe it. Awfully.
You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep
thinking&mdash;from time to time, of course, not all the while. It's
impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell
with their hooks when I die. Then I wonder&mdash;hooks? Where would
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do they forge
them? Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in
the monastery probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance.
Now I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling.
It makes it more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is.
And, after all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't?
But, do you know, there's a damnable question involved in it? If
there's no ceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks
it all breaks down, which is unlikely again, for then there would be
none to drag me down to hell, and if they don't drag me down what
justice is there in the world? <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Il faudrait les
inventer</foreign>, those hooks,
on purpose for me alone, for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a
blackguard I am.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But there are no hooks there,</q> said Alyosha, looking gently and
seriously at his father.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know. That's
how a Frenchman described hell: <q><foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>J'ai bu l'ombre d'un
cocher qui avec l'ombre d'une brosse frottait l'ombre d'une carrosse.</foreign></q> How do
you know there are no hooks, darling? When you've lived with
the monks you'll sing a different tune. But go and get at the truth
there, and then come and tell me. Anyway it's easier going to the
other world if one knows what there is there. Besides, it will be
more seemly for you with the monks than here with me, with a
drunken old man and young harlots ... though you're like an
angel, nothing touches you. And I dare say nothing will touch
you there. That's why I let you go, because I hope for that.
You've got all your wits about you. You will burn and you will
burn out; you will be healed and come back again. And I will wait
for you. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who has
not condemned me. My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can't help
feeling it.</q>
</p>

<p>
And he even began blubbering. He was sentimental. He was
wicked and sentimental.

<head>Chapter V. Elders</head>

<p>
Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a
sickly, ecstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive
dreamer. On the contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well-grown,
red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health. He
was very handsome, too, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a
dark brown, with a regular, rather long, oval-shaped face, and wide-set
dark gray, shining eyes; he was very thoughtful, and apparently
very serene. I shall be told, perhaps, that red cheeks are not incompatible
with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy that Alyosha
was more of a realist than any one. Oh! no doubt, in the monastery
he fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are never
a stumbling-block to the realist. It is not miracles that dispose
realists to belief. The genuine realist, if he is an unbeliever, will
always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and
if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would
rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact. Even if he
admits it, he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by
him. Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the
miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he is bound
by his very realism to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle
Thomas said that he would not believe till he saw, but when he did
see he said, <q>My Lord and my God!</q> Was it the miracle forced
him to believe? Most likely not, but he believed solely because he
desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart
even when he said, <q>I do not believe till I see.</q>
</p>

<p>
I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had
not finished his studies, and so on. That he did not finish his studies
is true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
I'll simply repeat what I have said above. He entered upon
this path only because, at that time, it alone struck his imagination
and presented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for
his soul from darkness to light. Add to that that he was to some
extent a youth of our last epoch&mdash;that is, honest in nature, desiring
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
the truth, seeking for it and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at
once with all the strength of his soul, seeking for immediate action,
and ready to sacrifice everything, life itself, for it. Though these
young men unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is,
in many cases, the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for
instance, five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious
study, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth
and the cause they have set before them as their goal&mdash;such a sacrifice
is utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path
Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he
chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he
reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and
immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: <q>I want
to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.</q> In the
same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist,
he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism
is not merely the labor question, it is before all things the atheistic
question, the question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the
question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount
to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth. Alyosha would
have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before. It
is written: <q>Give all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me, if
thou wouldst be perfect.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha said to himself: <q>I can't give two roubles instead of
<q>all,</q> and only go to mass instead of <q>following Him.</q></q> Perhaps his
memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his
mother may have taken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight
and the holy image to which his poor <q>crazy</q> mother had held him
up still acted upon his imagination. Brooding on these things he may
have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice
all or only <q>two roubles,</q> and in the monastery he met this elder.
I must digress to explain what an <q>elder</q> is in Russian monasteries,
and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do so. I will
try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a few words.
Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of <q>elders</q> is
of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries,
though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos, it has
existed over a thousand years. It is maintained that it existed in
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook
Russia&mdash;the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations
with the East after the destruction of Constantinople&mdash;this institution
fell into oblivion. It was revived among us towards the end
of last century by one of the great <q>ascetics,</q> as they called him,
Païssy Velitchkovsky, and his disciples. But to this day it exists in
few monasteries only, and has sometimes been almost persecuted as
an innovation in Russia. It flourished especially in the celebrated
Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was introduced into
our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three such
elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost dying
of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The
question for our monastery was an important one, for it had not
been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they had
neither relics of saints, nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious
traditions, nor historical exploits. It had flourished and been glorious
all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had
flocked for thousands of miles from all parts.
</p>

<p>
What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul,
your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder,
you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission,
complete self-abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible
school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest,
of self-mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to
attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those
who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves
in themselves. This institution of elders is not founded on theory,
but was established in the East from the practice of a thousand
years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary <q>obedience</q>
which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The
obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted
themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him
and them.
</p>

<p>
The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity
one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon
him by his elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt.
There, after great exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer
torture and a martyr's death for the faith. When the Church, regarding
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
him as a saint, was burying him, suddenly, at the deacon's
exhortation, <q>Depart all ye unbaptized,</q> the coffin containing the
martyr's body left its place and was cast forth from the church,
and this took place three times. And only at last they learnt that
this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and left his elder,
and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder's absolution
in spite of his great deeds. Only after this could the funeral take
place. This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent
instance.
</p>

<p>
A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos,
which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go
first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go
to the north to Siberia: <q>There is the place for thee and not here.</q>
The monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to the Œcumenical
Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him to release him from
his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that not only was he unable
to release him, but there was not and could not be on earth a power
which could release him except the elder who had himself laid that
duty upon him. In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases
with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many
of our monasteries the institution was at first resisted almost to
persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly
esteemed among the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well
as men of distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our
monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings,
and ask for counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of
the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being
arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the continual opening
of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing
of the character of the sacrament. In the end, however, the institution
of elders has been retained and is becoming established in
Russian monasteries. It is true, perhaps, that this instrument which
had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration
of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may
be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and
complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to
bondage and not to freedom.
</p>

<p>
The elder Zossima was sixty-five. He came of a family of landowners,
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
had been in the army in early youth, and served in the
Caucasus as an officer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by
some peculiar quality of his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the
elder, who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him. It
must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could
go where he pleased and be absent for whole days. Though he wore
the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others.
No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination was
deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that
so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to
Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing,
that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an
unknown face what a new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering
on his conscience. He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed
his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken
a word.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for
the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with
bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the
fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he
was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more
drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner
the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of
his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they
were few in number and they were silent, though among them were
some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the
older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows
of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima's side and very
many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.
Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though
not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt
of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and
great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics.
Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the
elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin
that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick
children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
and to pray over them, return shortly after&mdash;some the next day&mdash;and,
falling in tears at the elder's feet, thank him for healing their
sick.
</p>

<p>
Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the
natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for
Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher
and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own
triumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over
when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting
crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from
all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing.
They fell down before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed the earth
on which he stood, and wailed, while the women held up their children
to him and brought him the sick <q>possessed with devils.</q>
The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed them,
and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks
of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and
the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha
did not wonder why they loved him so, why they fell down before
him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face. Oh! he
understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant, worn
out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting injustice and
everlasting sin, his own and the world's, it was the greatest need
and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before
and worship.
</p>

<p>
<q>Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere
on earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the
truth; he knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it
will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according to
the promise.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even
reasoned. He understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this
saint and custodian of God's truth&mdash;of that he had no more doubt
than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their
children to the elder. The conviction that after his death the elder
would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger
in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind of deep flame
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart. He
was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a solitary example
before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>No matter. He is holy. He carries in his heart the secret of
renewal for all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on
the earth, and all men will be holy and love one another, and there
will be no more rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will
be as the children of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will
come.</q> That was the dream in Alyosha's heart.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of his two brothers, whom he had not known till
then, seemed to make a great impression on Alyosha. He more
quickly made friends with his half-brother Dmitri (though he arrived
later) than with his own brother Ivan. He was extremely
interested in his brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two
months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were
still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed to be
expecting something, ashamed about something, while his brother
Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and
curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him.
Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his
brother's indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education.
But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and
sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown
to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something&mdash;something
inward and important&mdash;that he was striving
towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was
why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether
there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for
him&mdash;a foolish novice. He knew for certain that his brother was
an atheist. He could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed;
yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand,
he waited for his brother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used
to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar
earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of the important
affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable
bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri's enthusiastic references
to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri
was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be
difficult to find two men more unlike.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, are you coming to the Superior?</q> Miüsov asked Ivan
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why not? I was especially invited yesterday.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded
dinner,</q> said Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the
fact that the monk was listening. <q>We ought, at least, to apologize
for the disturbance, and explain that it was not our doing. What
do you think?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, we must explain that it wasn't our doing. Besides, father
won't be there,</q> observed Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner!</q>
</p>

<p>
They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. On
the road through the copse he made one observation however&mdash;that
the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they
were more than half an hour late. He received no answer. Miüsov
looked with hatred at Ivan.
</p>

<p>
<q>Here he is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,</q>
he thought. <q>A brazen face, and the conscience of a
Karamazov!</q>

<head>Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career</head>

<p>
Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his bedroom and seated
him on his bed. It was a little room furnished with the bare
necessities. There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt
for a mattress. In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk
with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted
on the bed. His eyes glittered and he breathed hard. He looked
intently at Alyosha, as though considering something.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste,
you are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Let me stay here,</q> Alyosha entreated.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will
wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And
remember, my son</q>&mdash;the elder liked to call him that&mdash;<q>this is not the
place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call me, leave
the monastery. Go away for good.</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha started.
</p>

<p>
<q>What crime? What murderer? What do you mean?</q>
</p>

<p>
Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too.
</p>

<p>
<q>What murderer? As though you didn't know! I'll bet you've
thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen,
Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between
two stools. Have you thought of it or not? Answer.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have,</q> answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was
taken aback.
</p>

<p>
<q>What? Have you really?</q> he cried.
</p>

<p>
<q>I ... I've not exactly thought it,</q> muttered Alyosha, <q>but
directly you began speaking so strangely, I fancied I had thought
of it myself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You see? (And how well you expressed it!) Looking at your
father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime.
Then I'm not mistaken?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But wait, wait a minute,</q> Alyosha broke in uneasily. <q>What
has led you to see all this? Why does it interest you? That's the
first question.</q>
</p>

<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>

<p>
<q>Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them
separately. What led me to see it? I shouldn't have seen it, if I
hadn't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the
very heart of him all at once. I caught the whole man from one
trait. These very honest but passionate people have a line which
mustn't be crossed. If it were, he'd run at your father with a
knife. But your father's a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who
can never draw the line&mdash;if they both let themselves go, they'll
both come to grief.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't
come to that.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he may be honest,
our Mitya (he is stupid, but honest), but he's&mdash;a sensualist. That's
the very definition and inner essence of him. It's your father has
handed him on his low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder
at you, Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a
Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to
a disease. But now, these three sensualists are watching one another,
with their knives in their belts. The three of them are
knocking their heads together, and you may be the fourth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri&mdash;despises her,</q>
said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder.
</p>

<p>
<q>Grushenka? No, brother, he doesn't despise her. Since he has
openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn't despise her.
There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand
yet. A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's
body, or even with a part of a woman's body (a sensualist can understand
that), and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his
father and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he's honest,
he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive.
Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in his verse.
Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at their feet
without a thrill&mdash;and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no help
here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he
can't tear himself away.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand that,</q> Alyosha jerked out suddenly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it
out at the first word,</q> said Rakitin, malignantly. <q>That escaped
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a
familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about sensuality,
I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're
a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you've thought
about, and what you know already! You are pure, but you've been
down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long time.
You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov&mdash;no
doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a
sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother. Why
do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has
been begging me to bring you along. <q>I'll pull off his cassock,</q> she
says. You can't think how she keeps begging me to bring you. I
wondered why she took such an interest in you. Do you know,
she's an extraordinary woman, too!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thank her and say I'm not coming,</q> said Alyosha, with a
strained smile. <q>Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you
my idea after.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There's nothing to finish. It's all clear. It's the same old tune,
brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother,
Ivan? He's a Karamazov, too. What is at the root of all you
Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! Your
brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown
motive of his own, though he's an atheist, and he admits it's
a fraud himself&mdash;that's your brother Ivan. He's trying to get
Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he'll succeed, too. And
what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender
his betrothed to him to be rid of her, and escape to Grushenka.
And he's ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness.
Observe that. Those are the most fatal people! Who the
devil can make you out? He recognizes his vileness and goes on
with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing
in Mitya's way now. He has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka.
His mouth waters at the sight of her. It's simply on her account
he made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Miüsov
called her an <q>abandoned creature.</q> He's worse than a tom-cat in
love. At first she was only employed by him in connection with
his taverns and in some other shady business, but now he has suddenly
realized all she is and has gone wild about her. He keeps
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
pestering her with his offers, not honorable ones, of course. And
they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path!
But Grushenka favors neither of them, she's still playing with them,
and teasing them both, considering which she can get most out of.
For though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldn't
marry her, and maybe he'll turn stingy in the end, and keep his
purse shut. That's where Mitya's value comes in; he has no money,
but he's ready to marry her. Yes, ready to marry her! to abandon
his betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and
the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been
the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated,
provincial mayor. Some murderous conflict may well
come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is
waiting for. It would suit him down to the ground. He'll carry
off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her
dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a
man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won't
be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know
as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy
girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of
his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man
who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end
refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She's hesitating between
the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so
that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying
himself at your expense.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?</q>
Alyosha asked sharply, frowning.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows
that you know I'm speaking the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You don't like Ivan. Ivan wouldn't be tempted by money.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Really? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It's not only
the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ivan is above that. He wouldn't make up to any one for
thousands. It is not money, it's not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps
it's suffering he is seeking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What wild dream now? Oh, you&mdash;aristocrats!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage.
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt. He is one of those who
don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's plagiarism, Alyosha. You're quoting your elder's phrases.
Ah, Ivan has set you a problem!</q> cried Rakitin, with undisguised
malice. His face changed, and his lips twitched. <q>And the problem's
a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains&mdash;you'll
understand it. His article is absurd and ridiculous. And did
you hear his stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of
the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful. (And
by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out:
<q>I will remember!</q>) An attractive theory for scoundrels!&mdash;(I'm
being abusive, that's stupid.) Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic
<foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>poseurs</foreign>, <q>haunted by profound,
unsolved doubts.</q> He's showing off,
and what it all comes to is, <q>on the one hand we cannot but admit</q>
and <q>on the other it must be confessed!</q> His whole theory is a
fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue
even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love for
freedom, for equality, for fraternity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat, but, suddenly, as
though remembering something, he stopped short.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, that's enough,</q> he said, with a still more crooked smile.
<q>Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, I never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool. You are
clever but ... never mind, I was silly to smile. I understand your
getting hot about it, Misha. I guess from your warmth that you
are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that
for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan.
Are you jealous of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And jealous of her money, too? Won't you add that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother
Ivan with you. Don't you understand that one might very well
dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil
should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why
haven't I a right to abuse him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I never heard of his saying anything about you, good or bad.
He doesn't speak of you at all.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But I heard that the day before yesterday at Katerina Ivanovna's
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
he was abusing me for all he was worth&mdash;you see what an interest
he takes in your humble servant. And which is the jealous one
after that, brother, I can't say. He was so good as to express the
opinion that, if I don't go in for the career of an archimandrite in
the immediate future and don't become a monk, I shall be sure to
go to Petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer,
that I shall write for the next ten years, and in the end become the
owner of the magazine, and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic
side, with a socialistic tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping
a sharp look out all the time, that is, keeping in with both sides
and hoodwinking the fools. According to your brother's account,
the tinge of socialism won't hinder me from laying by the proceeds
and investing them under the guidance of some Jew, till at the end
of my career I build a great house in Petersburg and move my publishing
offices to it, and let out the upper stories to lodgers. He has
even chosen the place for it, near the new stone bridge across the
Neva, which they say is to be built in Petersburg.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, Misha, that's just what will really happen, every word of
it,</q> cried Alyosha, unable to restrain a good-humored smile.
</p>

<p>
<q>You are pleased to be sarcastic, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, no, I'm joking, forgive me. I've something quite different
in my mind. But, excuse me, who can have told you all this? You
can't have been at Katerina Ivanovna's yourself when he was talking
about you?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wasn't there, but Dmitri Fyodorovitch was; and I heard him
tell it with my own ears; if you want to know, he didn't tell me, but
I overheard him, unintentionally, of course, for I was sitting in
Grushenka's bedroom and I couldn't go away because Dmitri Fyodorovitch
was in the next room.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, yes, I'd forgotten she was a relation of yours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A relation! That Grushenka a relation of mine!</q> cried Rakitin,
turning crimson. <q>Are you mad? You're out of your mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, isn't she a relation of yours? I heard so.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where can you have heard it? You Karamazovs brag of being
an ancient, noble family, though your father used to run about
playing the buffoon at other men's tables, and was only admitted to
the kitchen as a favor. I may be only a priest's son, and dirt in
the eyes of noblemen like you, but don't insult me so lightly and
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I
couldn't be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you
to understand that!</q>
</p>

<p>
Rakitin was intensely irritated.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, for goodness' sake, I had no idea ... besides ...
how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?</q>
Alyosha flushed suddenly. <q>I tell you again, I heard that she was a
relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself
you're not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people
had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That's not your
business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father,
is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are.
You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it?
Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon! Have the
Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have.
Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him. They've
broken out from the Father Superior's. And look, Father Isidor's
shouting out something after them from the steps. And your
father's shouting and waving his arms. I expect he's swearing.
Bah, and there goes Miüsov driving away in his carriage. You see,
he's going. And there's old Maximov running!&mdash;there must have
been a row. There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not
been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been
beaten? It would serve them right!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a
scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse
of a moment.
</p>

<head>Chapter VIII. The Scandalous Scene</head>

<p>
Miüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but
feel some inward qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's
with Ivan: he felt ashamed of having lost his temper. He felt
that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's
cell, and so to have forgotten himself. <q>The monks were not to
blame, in any case,</q> he reflected, on the steps. <q>And if they're
decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a
nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't
argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show
them that I've nothing to do with that Æsop,
that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this
affair, just as they have.</q>
</p>

<p>
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and
relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once.
He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become
much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the
wood and river in question were.
</p>

<p>
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the
Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not
a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether;
they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than
Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing
of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered
with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not
even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there
were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous
thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully
decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were
three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent
mead, and a large glass jug of kvas&mdash;both the latter made in
the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no
vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup
made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish
served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote,
and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these
good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where
he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got
information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious
temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and
nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would
play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable,
and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the
contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table
he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any
one else could have influenced him in that.
</p>

<p>
Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be
invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and one
other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They
were already waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The
Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his
guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black
hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed
to his guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive
his blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father
Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute. But Ivan and
Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted
and complete manner, kissing his hand as peasants do.
</p>

<p>
<q>We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,</q> began Miüsov,
simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone.
<q>Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited,
Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor
of your hospitality, and not without reason. In the reverend Father
Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with
his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ...
in fact, quite unseemly ... as</q>&mdash;he glanced at the monks&mdash;<q>your
reverence is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognizing
that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and
begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his
apologies and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends
later. He asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken
place.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he uttered the last word of his tirade, Miüsov completely recovered
his self-complacency, and all traces of his former irritation
disappeared. He fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes,</q> said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya
paused for a minute and said suddenly:
</p>

<p>
<q>And how they worked it up at the trial! Didn't they work it
up!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,</q>
said Alyosha, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it's hard,</q>
Mitya moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once!</q> he exclaimed suddenly.
<q>Tell me, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did
she say? How did she say it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>She said she would come, but I don't know whether she will
come to-day. It's hard for her, you know,</q> Alyosha looked timidly
at his brother.
</p>

<p>
<q>I should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out
of my mind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My
God, calm my heart: what is it I want? I want Katya! Do I
understand what I want? It's the headstrong, evil Karamazov
spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a scoundrel, that's all
one can say.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Here she is!</q> cried Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment
she stood still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He leapt
impulsively to his feet, and a scared look came into his face. He
turned pale, but a timid, pleading smile appeared on his lips at once,
and with an irresistible impulse he held out both hands to Katya.
Seeing it, she flew impetuously to him. She seized him by the hands,
and almost by force made him sit down on the bed. She sat down
beside him, and still keeping his hands pressed them violently.
Several times they both strove to speak, but stopped short and again
gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyes fastened on one
another. So passed two minutes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have you forgiven me?</q> Mitya faltered at last, and at the same
moment turning to Alyosha, his face working with joy, he cried,
<q>Do you hear what I am asking, do you hear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!</q>
<pb n='866'/><anchor id='Pg866'/>
broke from Katya. <q>My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours
to me; whether you forgive me or not, you will always be a sore
place in my heart, and I in yours&mdash;so it must be....</q> She stopped
to take breath. <q>What have I come for?</q> she began again with
nervous haste: <q>to embrace your feet, to press your hands like this,
till it hurts&mdash;you remember how in Moscow I used to squeeze them&mdash;to
tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you that I
love you madly,</q> she moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed his
hand greedily to her lips. Tears streamed from her eyes. Alyosha
stood speechless and confounded; he had never expected what he was
seeing.
</p>

<p>
<q>Love is over, Mitya!</q> Katya began again, <q>but the past is painfully
dear to me. Know that you will always be so. But now let
what might have been come true for one minute,</q> she faltered, with
a drawn smile, looking into his face joyfully again. <q>You love another
woman, and I love another man, and yet I shall love you for
ever, and you will love me; do you know that? Do you hear?
Love me, love me all your life!</q> she cried, with a quiver almost of
menace in her voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,</q> Mitya began,
drawing a deep breath at each word, <q>do you know, five days ago,
that same evening, I loved you.... When you fell down and were
carried out ... All my life! So it will be, so it will always be&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
So they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless,
perhaps not even true, but at that moment it was all true,
and they both believed what they said implicitly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Katya,</q> cried Mitya suddenly, <q>do you believe I murdered him?
I know you don't believe it now, but then ... when you gave
evidence.... Surely, surely you did not believe it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I did not believe it even then. I've never believed it. I hated
you, and for a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving
evidence I persuaded myself and believed it, but when I'd finished
speaking I left off believing it at once. Don't doubt that! I have
forgotten that I came here to punish myself,</q> she said, with a new
expression in her voice, quite unlike the loving tones of a moment
before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Woman, yours is a heavy burden,</q> broke, as it were, involuntarily
from Mitya.
</p>

<pb n='867'/><anchor id='Pg867'/>

<p>
<q>Let me go,</q> she whispered. <q>I'll come again. It's more than I
can bear now.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud
scream and staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly
into the room. No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly
to the door, but when she reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly,
turned as white as chalk and moaned softly, almost in a whisper:
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive,
venomous voice, answered:
</p>

<p>
<q>We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of
hatred! As though we could forgive one another! Save him, and
I'll worship you all my life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>You won't forgive her!</q> cried Mitya, with frantic reproach.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't be anxious, I'll save him for you!</q> Katya whispered
rapidly, and she ran out of the room.
</p>

<p>
<q>And you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your
forgiveness herself?</q> Mitya exclaimed bitterly again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mitya, don't dare to blame her; you have no right to!</q> Alyosha
cried hotly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Her proud lips spoke, not her heart,</q> Grushenka brought out in
a tone of disgust. <q>If she saves you I'll forgive her everything&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
She stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She
could not yet recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards,
accidentally, with no suspicion of what she would meet.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alyosha, run after her!</q> Mitya cried to his brother; <q>tell her ... I
don't know ... don't let her go away like this!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I'll come to you again at nightfall,</q> said Alyosha, and he ran
after Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She
was walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said
quickly:
</p>

<p>
<q>No, before that woman I can't punish myself! I asked her forgiveness
because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She
would not forgive me.... I like her for that!</q> she added, in an
unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment.
</p>

<p>
<q>My brother did not expect this in the least,</q> muttered Alyosha.
<q>He was sure she would not come&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No doubt. Let us leave that,</q> she snapped. <q>Listen: I can't
<pb n='868'/><anchor id='Pg868'/>
go with you to the funeral now. I've sent them flowers. I think
they still have money. If necessary, tell them I'll never abandon
them.... Now leave me, leave me, please. You are late as it is&mdash;the
bells are ringing for the service.... Leave me, please!</q>

<head>Chapter III. Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech At The Stone</head>

<p>
He really was late. They had waited for him and had already
decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the
church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He
had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the
house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha's schoolfellows.
They had all been impatiently expecting him and were
glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them,
they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. <q>Father
will cry, be with father,</q> Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and
the boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>How glad I am you've come, Karamazov!</q> he cried, holding out
his hand to Alyosha. <q>It's awful here. It's really horrible to see it.
Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he's had nothing to
drink to-day, but he seems as if he were drunk ... I am always
manly, but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one
question before you go in?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, Kolya?</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father
or was it the valet? As you say, so it will be. I haven't slept for
the last four nights for thinking of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The valet killed him, my brother is innocent,</q> answered Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>That's what I said,</q> cried Smurov.
</p>

<p>
<q>So he will perish an innocent victim!</q> exclaimed Kolya; <q>though
he is ruined he is happy! I could envy him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you mean? How can you? Why?</q> cried Alyosha surprised.
</p>

<pb n='869'/><anchor id='Pg869'/>

<p>
<q>Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!</q> said
Kolya with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
<q>But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!</q>
said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for
disgrace, I don't care about that&mdash;our names may perish. I respect
your brother!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And so do I!</q> the boy, who had once declared that he knew who
had founded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed
up to his ears like a peony as he had done on that occasion.
</p>

<p>
Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his hands folded
and his eyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it. His
thin face was hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no
smell of decay from the corpse. The expression of his face was
serious and, as it were, thoughtful. His hands, crossed over his
breast, looked particularly beautiful, as though chiseled in marble.
There were flowers in his hands and the coffin, inside and out, was
decked with flowers, which had been sent early in the morning by
Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna,
and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain had a bunch in his
trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear boy.
He scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he came in, and he would not
look at any one, even at his crazy weeping wife, <q>mamma,</q> who
kept trying to stand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her
dead boy. Nina had been pushed in her chair by the boys close up
to the coffin. She sat with her head pressed to it and she too was no
doubt quietly weeping. Snegiryov's face looked eager, yet bewildered
and exasperated. There was something crazy about his
gestures and the words that broke from him. <q>Old man, dear old
man!</q> he exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was his habit
to call Ilusha <q>old man,</q> as a term of affection when he was alive.
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his
hand and give it me,</q> the crazy mother begged, whimpering. Either
because the little white rose in Ilusha's hand had caught her fancy
or that she wanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him,
she moved restlessly, stretching out her hands for the flower.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't give it to any one, I won't give you anything,</q> Snegiryov
<pb n='870'/><anchor id='Pg870'/>
cried callously. <q>They are his flowers, not yours! Everything is
his, nothing is yours!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Father, give mother a flower!</q> said Nina, lifting her face wet
with tears.
</p>

<p>
<q>I won't give away anything and to her less than any one! She
didn't love Ilusha. She took away his little cannon and he gave it
to her,</q> the captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how
Ilusha had given up his cannon to his mother. The poor, crazy
creature was bathed in noiseless tears, hiding her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
The boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and
that it was time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and
began to lift it up.
</p>

<p>
<q>I don't want him to be buried in the churchyard,</q> Snegiryov
wailed suddenly; <q>I'll bury him by the stone, by our stone! Ilusha
told me to. I won't let him be carried out!</q>
</p>

<p>
He had been saying for the last three days that he would bury
him by the stone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her sister
and all the boys interfered.
</p>

<p>
<q>What an idea, bury him by an unholy stone, as though he had
hanged himself!</q> the old landlady said sternly. <q>There in the
churchyard the ground has been crossed. He'll be prayed for there.
One can hear the singing in church and the deacon reads so plainly
and verbally that it will reach him every time just as though it were
read over his grave.</q>
</p>

<p>
At last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say,
<q>Take him where you will.</q> The boys raised the coffin, but as they
passed the mother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that
she might say good-by to Ilusha. But on seeing that precious little
face, which for the last three days she had only looked at from a
distance, she trembled all over and her gray head began twitching
spasmodically over the coffin.
</p>

<p>
<q>Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your
blessing, kiss him,</q> Nina cried to her. But her head still twitched
like an automaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she
began, without a word, beating her breast with her fist. They
carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed her lips to her brother's
for the last time as they bore the coffin by her. As Alyosha went
out of the house he begged the landlady to look after those who
<pb n='871'/><anchor id='Pg871'/>
were left behind, but she interrupted him before he had finished.
</p>

<p>
<q>To be sure, I'll stay with them, we are Christians, too.</q> The
old woman wept as she said it.
</p>

<p>
They had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more
than three hundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight
frost. The church bells were still ringing. Snegiryov ran fussing
and distracted after the coffin, in his short old summer overcoat,
with his head bare and his soft, old, wide-brimmed hat in his hand.
He seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety. At one minute he
stretched out his hand to support the head of the coffin and only
hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and tried to find
a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he rushed
to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the
loss of that flower.
</p>

<p>
<q>And the crust of bread, we've forgotten the crust!</q> he cried
suddenly in dismay. But the boys reminded him at once that he
had taken the crust of bread already and that it was in his pocket.
He instantly pulled it out and was reassured.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,</q> he explained at once to Alyosha. <q>I
was sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me: <q>Father, when
my grave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the
sparrows may fly down, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not
to be lying alone.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That's a good thing,</q> said Alyosha, <q>we must often take some.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Every day, every day!</q> said the captain quickly, seeming cheered
at the thought.
</p>

<p>
They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle
of it. The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so,
all through the service. It was an old and rather poor church;
many of the ikons were without settings; but such churches are
the best for praying in. During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat
calmer, though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious
and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At one moment he went
up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle
fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful
time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the
coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the
Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside
<pb n='872'/><anchor id='Pg872'/>
him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain
what he meant. During the prayer, <q>Like the Cherubim,</q> he joined
in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he
pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.
</p>

<p>
At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed.
The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching
and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He
seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs,
which he tried at first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When
they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung
his arms about, as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha,
and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips.
At last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the
step, but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and
snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He looked at them and a
new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he apparently forgot
his grief for a minute. Gradually he seemed to sink into brooding
and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to the
grave. It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the
church, Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary
rites the grave-diggers lowered the coffin. Snegiryov with his
flowers in his hands bent down so low over the open grave that
the boys caught hold of his coat in alarm and pulled him back.
He did not seem to understand fully what was happening. When
they began filling up the grave, he suddenly pointed anxiously at
the falling earth and began trying to say something, but no one
could make out what he meant, and he stopped suddenly. Then he
was reminded that he must crumble the bread and he was awfully
excited, snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and
flinging the morsels on the grave.
</p>

<p>
<q>Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!</q> he muttered anxiously.
</p>

<p>
One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble
the bread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give
them to some one to hold for a time. But he would not do this and
seemed indeed suddenly alarmed for his flowers, as though they
wanted to take them from him altogether. And after looking at
the grave, and as it were, satisfying himself that everything had been
<pb n='873'/><anchor id='Pg873'/>
done and the bread had been crumbled, he suddenly, to the surprise
of every one, turned, quite composedly even, and made his way
homewards. But his steps became more and more hurried, he almost
ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him.
</p>

<p>
<q>The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I
was unkind to mamma,</q> he began exclaiming suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Some one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold. But he
flung the hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating,
<q>I won't have the hat, I won't have the hat.</q> Smurov picked
it up and carried it after him. All the boys were crying, and Kolya
and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all. Though
Smurov, with the captain's hat in his hand, was crying bitterly too,
he managed, as he ran, to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on
the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was
flying by. He missed them, of course, and went on crying as he ran.
Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a minute,
as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to the
church, ran towards the deserted grave. But the boys instantly
overtook him and caught hold of him on all sides. Then he fell
helpless on the snow as though he had been knocked down, and
struggling, sobbing, and wailing, he began crying out, <q>Ilusha, old
man, dear old man!</q> Alyosha and Kolya tried to make him get up,
soothing and persuading him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,</q> muttered
Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>You'll spoil the flowers,</q> said Alyosha, <q>and mamma is expecting
them, she is sitting crying because you would not give her any
before. Ilusha's little bed is still there&mdash;</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, mamma!</q> Snegiryov suddenly recollected, <q>they'll take
away the bed, they'll take it away,</q> he added as though alarmed that
they really would. He jumped up and ran homewards again. But
it was not far off and they all arrived together. Snegiryov opened
the door hurriedly and called to his wife with whom he had so cruelly
quarreled just before:
</p>

<p>
<q>Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,</q>
he cried, holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been
frozen and broken while he was struggling in the snow. But at that
instant he saw in the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha's little boots,
<pb n='874'/><anchor id='Pg874'/>
which the landlady had put tidily side by side. Seeing the old,
patched, rusty-looking, stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed
to them, fell on his knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his
lips to it, began kissing it greedily, crying, <q>Ilusha, old man, dear
old man, where are your little feet?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where have you taken him away? Where have you taken him?</q>
the lunatic cried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs.
Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha
too went out.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let them weep,</q> he said to Kolya, <q>it's no use trying to comfort
them just now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No, it's no use, it's awful,</q> Kolya assented. <q>Do you know,
Karamazov,</q> he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them,
<q>I feel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him
back, I'd give anything in the world to do it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, so would I,</q> said Alyosha.
</p>

<p>
<q>What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here
to-night? He'll be drunk, you know.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be
enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina.
If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again,</q>
Alyosha suggested.
</p>

<p>
<q>That will be so, I understand you, Karamazov!</q> cried Kolya,
with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
The boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something,
but they restrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion
at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
<q>I say this in case we become bad,</q> Alyosha went on, <q>but there's
no reason why we should become bad, is there, boys? Let us be,
first and above all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget
each other! I say that again. I give you my word for my part
that I'll never forget one of you. Every face looking at me now
I shall remember even for thirty years. Just now Kolya said to
Kartashov that we did not care to know whether he exists or not.
But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and that he is not blushing
now as he did when he discovered the founders of Troy, but is
looking at me with his jolly, kind, dear little eyes. Boys, my dear
boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, brave and
generous like Kolya (though he will be ever so much cleverer when
he is grown up), and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet as
Kartashov. But why am I talking about those two? You are all
dear to me, boys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart
for you all, and I beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me!
Well, and who has united us in this kind, good feeling which we
shall remember and intend to remember all our lives? Who, if not
<pb n='877'/><anchor id='Pg877'/>
Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to us for ever! Let us
never forget him. May his memory live for ever in our hearts from
this time forth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes, for ever, for ever!</q> the boys cried in their ringing
voices, with softened faces.
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little
boots, his coffin and his unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he
stood up for him alone against the whole school.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will remember, we will remember,</q> cried the boys. <q>He
was brave, he was good!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how I loved him!</q> exclaimed Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don't be afraid of life! How
good life is when one does something good and just!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, yes,</q> the boys repeated enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov, we love you!</q> a voice, probably Kartashov's, cried
impulsively.
</p>

<p>
<q>We love you, we love you!</q> they all caught it up. There were
tears in the eyes of many of them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hurrah for Karamazov!</q> Kolya shouted ecstatically.
</p>

<p>
<q>And may the dead boy's memory live for ever!</q> Alyosha added
again with feeling.
</p>

<p>
<q>For ever!</q> the boys chimed in again.
</p>

<p>
<q>Karamazov,</q> cried Kolya, <q>can it be true what's taught us in
religion, that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and
see each other again, all, Ilusha too?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other
and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!</q>
Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, how splendid it will be!</q> broke from Kolya.
</p>

<p>
<q>Well, now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner.
Don't be put out at our eating pancakes&mdash;it's a very old custom
and there's something nice in that!</q> laughed Alyosha. <q>Well, let us
go! And now we go hand in hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And always so, all our lives hand in hand! Hurrah for Karamazov!</q>
Kolya cried once more rapturously, and once more the boys
took up his exclamation:
<q>Hurrah for Karamazov!</q>
