<q rend='pre'>But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul;
did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we
convict and punish him, he will say to himself: <q>These people
have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing
to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me
a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have
not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me
to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe
no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked.
They are cruel and I will be cruel.</q> That is what he will say, gentlemen
of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will
only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will
ot
he, not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the
other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his brother,</q>
Katya added, with flashing eyes&mdash;<q>told me the whole plan of escape
long ago. You know he has already entered into negotiations....
I've told you something already.... You see, it will probably come
off at the third <foreign rend='italic'>étape</foreign> from
here, when the party of prisoners is being
taken to Siberia. Oh, it's a long way off yet. Ivan Fyodorovitch has
already visited the superintendent of the third <foreign rend='italic'>étape</foreign>.
But we don't know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it's impossible
to find that out so long beforehand. To-morrow perhaps I will
show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me
on the eve of the trial in case of need.... That was when&mdash;do
you remember?&mdash;you found us quarreling. He had just gone down-stairs,
but seeing you I made him come back; do you remember?  
Do you know what we were quarreling about then?</q>
